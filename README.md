#Partaibook

Partaibook is an AI-powered event booking platform that helps people instantly plan and book informal events like birthdays, gender reveals, and small celebrations. Users describe their event idea, and Partaibook matches them with available local vendors who help make parties happen (like bakers, decorators, DJs, venues etc). Users go from search > booking their entire party in one seamless flow.

This is the main repo for the MVP build, built with Next.js, Supabase, and AI integrations.

Core Features:
- Smart Vendor Matching - Finds relevant vendors instantly based on event details.
- AI-Generated Order Notes + Visual References - Turns user requests and links (e.g. TikToks) into clear vendor briefs.
- Ghosting Protection - Re-matches users if vendors donâ€™t respond in time.
- Vendor FAQ Assistant - Auto-replies to common user questions in a friendly tone.
- Group Planning Tools - RSVP sharing, shortlist saving, and cost splitting coming soon.
