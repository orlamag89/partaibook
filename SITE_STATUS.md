# Missing Images - Quick Fix

The site is actually loading successfully, but there are missing image files causing errors:

## Issues Found:
1. `/public/logo.png` - Missing logo file
2. `/public/placeholder.jpg` - Missing placeholder image

## Quick Fix:
1. **Add your logo**: Put your logo file as `logo.png` in the `/public` folder
2. **Add placeholder**: I'll create a temporary placeholder for you

## Current Status:
- ✅ Site compiles successfully 
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3002
- ✅ Pages load (GET / 200)
- ❌ Missing images causing visual issues

The site should be accessible at http://localhost:3002, but images won't display until you add the files.
